# BigBang_PrimeNumbers
This Python script generates an array of numbers from 1 to 100 and applies specific replacements based on divisibility rules. It replaces numbers divisible by 3 with the word "BIG," numbers divisible by 5 with the word "BANG," and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with "BIG BANG."

# How It Works
The script iterates through the numbers from 1 to 100 and applies the following rules:

If a number is divisible by 3, it replaces the number with "BIG."
If a number is divisible by 5, it replaces the number with "BANG."
If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it replaces the number with "BIG BANG."
Otherwise, it leaves the number unchanged.

The script is designed to generate the array of numbers from 1 to 100 and apply the specified replacements based on divisibility rules (divisible by 3, 5, or both).

Therefore, users don't need to provide any input when running this script. They can directly run the script, which will automatically iterate through the number from 1 to 100, generate the array with the appropriate replacements, and save the output to the 'output.json' file.

# How to run the script
1. Clone the GitHub repository containing the Python script and the Python script file (ipynb file) to your local machine.
2. Launch Notebook or Google Colab/Pycharm on your local machine.
3. Navigate to the file path or Download  and open the 'prime_numbers.ipynb' file by clicking on it.
4. In the notebook selected, run the cells to execute the script the output displayed in the notebook.
5. Review the results by checking if an 'output.json' file was generated in the same directory as the notebook. This file will contain the array with the replacements.
6. The JSON file can be downloaded and opened to view the generated array of output.
