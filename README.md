# BigBang_PrimeNumbers
This Python script generates an array of numbers from 1 to 100 and applies specific replacements based on divisibility rules. It replaces numbers divisible by 3 with the word "BIG," numbers divisible by 5 with the word "BANG," and numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 with "BIG BANG."
